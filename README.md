This notebook combines climate data (temperature, precipitation) with transport network analysis to model the potential risks posed by climate stressors on logistics and transport operations in Kaduna. It uses spatial analysis to identify vulnerable routes and propose resilience strategies for future climate change adaptation in urban mobility.
